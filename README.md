# Leetcode54-SpiralMatrix-java
This is an example of how to solve LeetCode 54 Traversing a spiral Matrix each  for loop and pointer alteration are documented to ensure ease of understanding for beginners. Keep in mind this algorithm performs n * m time complexity. n for number of  rows m being the number of columns in the matrix
Problem Description
Given an m x n matrix, the task is to return all elements of the matrix in spiral order. This means elements are printed starting from the top-left corner, moving right, then down, then left, and finally up, repeating these steps until all elements are printed.

Example
Consider the matrix:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
​
​
To solve this problem, you can use a loop that iterates over the boundaries of the matrix. 
The boundaries are defined by the starting row index (k), the starting column index (l), the ending row index (m-1), and the ending column index (n-1). 
The loop continues until all elements are printed.

Initialize:

Set k = 0 (starting row index)
Set l = 0 (starting column index)
Set m = matrix.size() (number of rows)
Set n = matrix[0].size() (number of columns)

Iterate:

Loop while k < m and l < n:
Traverse the top row from left to right and increment k.
Traverse the right column from top to bottom and decrement n.
Traverse the bottom row from right to left and decrement m.
Traverse the left column from bottom to top and increment l.
Return the result array containing the elements in spiral order.
This approach ensures that all elements are printed in the correct spiral order, moving clockwise around the matrix.
